        <h1>about me</h1>
 
        <p>My name is Lourdes (Luli) Schmader, and I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Literary, Cultural, and Linguistic Studies program at the University of Miami. My research intercepts two crucial themes related to the Kichwa cosmovision and language. The first line of study takes place in the United States and looks at the significant presence of the Kichwa diaspora community in Queens, New York. Interest is placed in their efforts to revitalize their ancestorsâ€™ language, the consolidation of their Indigenous roots outside the Ecuadorian territory, and how mobility has played a vital role in the extension of their identity.  </p>
